                        <p>Hello world! My name is Ray. I'm a full-stack web development student with University of Oregon's Coding Bootcamp. I also hold a bachelors in International Studies from Portland State University. While I am new to coding I look forward to the challenge of taking on this new skill and to growing into a new career path. So far I am most interested in front-end development as I am more design and creative oriented. The reason I got into coding is because my current job as a pharmacy technician doesn't allow for much creativity. I love to learn so I'm always looking for something new to try. </p>

                        <p>I am originally from Mexicali, Mexico and grew up mostly in and around the Portland, Oregon metro area. In addition to English I also speak Spanish and French. My hobbies are hiking, reading, travel and photography. Photography has always been my biggest passion. My dream job would be a to find a way to incorporate it into my coding career as well!</p>
